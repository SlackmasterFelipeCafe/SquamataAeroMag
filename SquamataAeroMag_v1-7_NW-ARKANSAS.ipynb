    "- Create entity and attribute XML markup for all files being released.\n",
    "- Poplulate metadata template\n",
    "- Validate metadata; create error log; create HTML and FGDC Text versions of the metadata. (In development - use https://mrdata.usgs.gov/validation/ for validation in the interim)\n",
